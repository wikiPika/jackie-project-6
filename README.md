# Project 6

The project description is provided in the file Project 6.pdf
You can implement your assembler in either Java, or Python. 
You will need to edit the lang.txt file with either "python3" or "java" in your ```/src``` directory.
You *must* include a HackAssembler.py or HackAseembler.java file in ```/src```.
We recommend following / implementing the APIs presented in lecture 6.

## Materials

```/tools```

This directory includes all the simulators and tools for this project.

```/src```
This directory includes all the files required to complete this project.

```/grader```
Do not modify this repository. It is necessary for running the github grading scripts.

When you push a change to github, an autograder script will be triggered. You will see a commit from the autograding workflow. When the workflow is complete (it may take a few seconds) you will see a grade assigned to the commit based on whether your chips (completed HDL programs) passed our tests. The output will look similar to the one you see when you run the test scripts locally, using the hardware simulator on your machine.

The autograding workflow may have some additional output to help you debug your chips. But, you must test your chips locally, and not rely solely on the autograder.

## Collaboration

You may work on this assignment in teams of two, or individually.
